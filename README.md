Due to some glitches, our main folders "FRONTEND and AI Integration" resulted as empty folders because those are inside the another folder. 
While we were checking the github, the form was already closed.
So we added all the files through add files option after the upload.
we have mentioned the files's work flow in the commit messages.
I apologise for the mistake.
